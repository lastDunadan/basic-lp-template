## Basic LP template

This is template for basic web projects like websites and landing pages that use `HTML/CSS/JS`. This template has `GULP task runner` configured with `SCSS` and `browserSync` support.

Very handy and done according to "KISS" principles. _William Ockham_ would be proud.

### How to use:

You will need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). After getting these two:

1) Install dependencies:  
`npm install gulp gulp-changed gulp-concat gulp-postcss gulp-sass gulp-terser gulp-webp postcss sass browser-sync cssnano`


2) Rund task runner with command:  
`gulp`


3) Remove unwanted teplate assets and have fun with your own.
